# Description
OCEANA: Treble Underwater is designed to provide a Mixed Reality experience that accompanies a live orchestra in real-time. The goal of this experience is to illustrate the harmful effects that sound pollution has on the ocean and its ecosystem. Through the use of MR technologies, animated 3D sea life, and particle effects, a story about the ocean and the effect pollution, specifically sound pollution, plays out in sync with the music, bringing out the emotions and themes within the music and engaging the audience with the orchestra. 

# Design Objectives
* Create a MR experience that emphasises the orchestra's music
* Make sure the experience does not distract from the orchestra
* Relay the message of how sound pollution affects the ocean

# Issues/Future Work
* Create an experience that lasts the entire song
* Add calbiration features to center the experience on the orchestra and scale it correctly
* Design interactive elements to further engage the user
